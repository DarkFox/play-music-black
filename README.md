# Dark Google Play Music
Since all good userstyles for Google Play Music's web client have broken with recent updates, I decided to make my own. :gem:

This style is not meant to mod the interface in any way, just make it black. It largely follows the Material Design guidelines for dark apps, but with slightly darker colors to get true night mode. It aims to recolor all elements in all views, but it's possible that I missed something - make an issue! It is built for the [November 2016 update to Play Music](https://blog.google/products/google-play/introducing-the-new-google-play-music/) and thus will probably glitch if that's not rolled out for you. Pull Requests and issues are welcomed!
